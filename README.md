# Basic EDA with HR IBM Employee Attrition using SQL

# Overview

# This project performs a basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the fictional IBM Employee Attrition dataset. Using SQL queries, we aim to uncover factors contributing to employee attrition and provide insights into employee demographics, job satisfaction, salary patterns, and more.

# About the Dataset

# Source: The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle.

# Purpose: Understand the key factors influencing employee attrition.

# Nature: Fictional dataset created by IBM data scientists.

# Workflow

# Step 1: Data Preparation
# Upload the dataset (Excel workbook) to SQL Server Management Studio.

# Confirm successful upload by querying the data:


# 1. Attrition Analysis

Identify total employees, count of employees with attrition, and calculate the attrition percentage:


# 2. Employee Demographics

Analyze demographics like age, gender, and marital status:


# 3. Business Travel Analysis

Examine the distribution of employees across business travel categories:


# 4. Department Analysis

Analyze employee distribution by department:


# 5. Job Role and Satisfaction Analysis

Evaluate job satisfaction, performance rating, and years in current role by job role:


# 6. Salary Analysis

Analyze average, maximum, and minimum salary by job role:


# 7. Satisfaction vs. Attrition

Explore relationships between job satisfaction, environment satisfaction, and attrition:

# 8. Age and Attrition

Analyze the relationship between age and attrition rates:

# 9. Overtime vs. Attrition

Evaluate the correlation between overtime and attrition rates:

# 10. Department & Role Attrition

Identify departments or roles with higher attrition rates:


# Insights

# Key insights can be derived from the above queries, such as:

# Attrition rates by department, role, or demographic group.

# Relationship between job satisfaction and attrition.

# Impact of overtime, salary, and travel requirements on employee retention.

# Tools Used

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): For running SQL queries and analyzing data.

Microsoft Excel: To upload and preprocess the dataset.

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL can be leveraged to uncover valuable insights from HR data. The analysis provides actionable insights into employee attrition patterns and factors influencing retention.
